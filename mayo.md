# Mayonaise

Mayonnaise, a beloved sauce and spread, has a history shrouded in a bit of mystery and debate. While the French popularized the sauce, its origins are often linked to the island of Menorca (Spain) in the 18th century, potentially during a French military victory. The sauce, originally called "mahonnaise" after the city of Mah√≥n, was reportedly created by a French chef as a celebratory dish.
